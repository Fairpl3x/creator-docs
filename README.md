# VRChat Creator Docs + i18n

## What is this?
This repository is a fork of the **VRChat Creator Docs** with integrated i18n support in the Docusaurus docs. This integration enables localization, making it possible to have VRChat Docs available in multiple languages.

This project is done independently and is not affiliated with VRChat. In other words, I'm working on this in my free time, without expecting VRChat to endorse these changes. My hope is that it can be of help to those who may not be very comfortable with English.

If you would like to help me translating the doc, most of the pages have an "Edit This Page".  
More language can be added if enough people are interested to work on specific translations.
